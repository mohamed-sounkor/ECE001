<h1><u>C Programming Language</u></h1>
<font size="4">C was originally developed at Bell Labs by <font color="blue">Dennis Ritchie</font> between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix. Later, it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.
During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity.
It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems.
    C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 and by the International Organization for Standardization. <br> </font>
