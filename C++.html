<h1><u>C++</u></h1>
<font size="4">C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by <font color="blue">Bjarne Stroustrup</font> as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".
The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
	C++ first appeared in 1985 <br> </font>

<h2><u>Used in</u></h2>
<font size="4">C++ is widely used in the real world, it's used in Games, GUI applications like most of Adobe applications and win amp media player.<br>
Operating systems are also partly written in C++ like Apple OS and windows Os like 95 , 98 and XP beside few applications like IDE visual studio, internet explorer and microsoft office. <br>
	Also other browsers like firefox and google applications are written in C++ in addition to Banking applications.<br> </font>
<h2><u>Coding Example</u></h2>
<font size="4">To print "Hello, world!" using C++, you have to type:</font><br><br>
<pre>
    #include iostream
	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
		cout << "Hello World!";
		return 0;
	}
</pre>
<font size="4">As you can see, it's more complicated than python and you have to include the iostream and other stuff. </font>
