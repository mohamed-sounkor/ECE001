<h1><u>Python</u></h1>
<font size="4">Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by <font color="blue">Guido van Rossum</font> and first released in 1991.
Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</font> <br>

<h2><u>Libraries (Modules)</u></h2>
<font size="4">Python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks.
For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported.
    It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.</font>
<h2><u>Used in</u></h2>
<font size="4">Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo!, CERN, NASA, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Spotify
    and some smaller entities like ILM and ITA. The social news networking site Reddit is written entirely in Python.</font>
<h2><u>Coding Example</u></h2>
<font size="4">To print "Hello, world!" using python, simply type: </font><br>
<br>
print("Hello, world!") <br>
<br>
<font size="4">you don't have to import any module like other languages, you just type what you want to be printed.<br>
    This easiness of python is considered as one of its most powerful points</font>
